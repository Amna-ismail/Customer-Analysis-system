In this Project I import data in SQL management studio, then analyze the  data through SQL queries, grouping the sales by product line, year id, deal size. After that preprocess the data by importing libraries, replace missing value, splitting dataset in independent (x) and dependent (y) variable, spitting dataset into training and testing, features scaling, apply K-Mean clustering.
Then connect SQL to Tableau also connect tabpy to tableau, and make the DYNAMIC DASHBOARDS (when I change in one table it will automatic change the whole dashboard).
 Project Goals: 

1. Perform a full customer analysis using a supervised dataset
2. Create a dashboard system to track purchases made by customers
3. Maintain a tracking process of revenue based on different criteria

 Key Tasks: 

1. Revenue by status
2. Revenue based on the product line
3. Sales by product line and order year
4. Monthly sales by country.

 Tools Used: 

1. SQL
2. Tableau
3. Excel
4. Anaconda (Jupyter)

 Classifier: 
K-Means

The system leverages these tools to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and revenue trends, helping businesses make informed decisions.
